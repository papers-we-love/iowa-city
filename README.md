# Iowa City - Update this file and the code of conduct!

This is the repository for the Iowa City chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/iowa-city/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### What is Papers We Love?

Papers We Love is a repository of academic computer science papers and a community who loves reading them.

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved?
What did it inspire you to build or tinker with?
Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers.
Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!).
Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.
